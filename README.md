### Hola!! 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer in love with React. Most recently I've been enjoying playing with Typescript and levelling up my testing game with Jest, Cypress & RTL.
My tech stack includes (but is not limited to) React, Redux, React Query, Express, Koa, MongoDB, Node.js, TypeScript, Angular.

🎈 currently working on this <a href="https://github.com/hucki/grouptripper">project</a>, and we have a demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22KtdN9gaAA">video</a> if you wanna check it out ✌️
